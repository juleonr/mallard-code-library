"""Seeded fixture for a two-by-two table: chi-square, Fisher's exact test and the odds ratio.

The outcome is drawn from a Bernoulli distribution whose probability depends only on the exposure,
so the odds ratio the generator implies IS the parameter the table estimates -- no model, no link
function, nothing to misspecify.

EXPECTED COUNTS ARE COMFORTABLY LARGE HERE, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE. Yates' continuity correction is
defended as a small-sample device, so a fixture with sparse cells would let a reader dismiss the
disagreement between packages as an edge case. It is not one: with two thousand patients and every
expected count in the hundreds, R and Python still report a different chi-square from SAS and Stata
by default, because R and Python apply the correction by default and the other two do not.

Stdlib only.

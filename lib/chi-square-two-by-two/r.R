# Two-by-two table: chi-square, Fisher's exact test and the odds ratio

# languages here is not capability but which test each one runs when you do not say.

# Levels are stated explicitly so the table is [exposed, unexposed] x [outcome, no outcome] rather
# than whatever order the factor happens to take. read.csv gives integers, which sort 0 then 1, so
# the table would otherwise be upside down and every quantity below would refer to the wrong cell
# while looking entirely reasonable.

# PINNED DEFAULT: correct = FALSE, the uncorrected Pearson chi-square.
#
# R and scipy BOTH apply Yates' continuity correction to a 2x2 by default. SAS PROC FREQ and Stata
# tabulate BOTH report the uncorrected Pearson as their chi-square. So the four languages split two
# against two, and on this fixture that is 49.90 against 49.19 -- with every expected count in the
# hundreds, which is not the sparse-table edge case the correction is usually defended for.
#
# Uncorrected is pinned because the correction is a small-sample device for approximating an exact
# conditional test, and it is conservative to a fault where the expected counts are large. Where
# they are NOT large, the honest answer is Fisher's exact test, computed below, rather than a
# corrected approximation.

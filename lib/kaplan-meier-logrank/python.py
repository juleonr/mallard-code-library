# Kaplan-Meier estimation and the log-rank test

# maintained survival library and the one whose confidence bands can be compared with R's.

# PINNED DEFAULT 1: the exponential Greenwood interval, which IS the log-log transform R is told to
# use above. lifelines does this and offers no alternative, which happens to match the pin; that is
# worth stating rather than relying on, because R's DEFAULT is the plain log transform and SAS's is
# log-log, so the same curve carries three different default bands across the three languages.

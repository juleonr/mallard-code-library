# Kaplan-Meier estimation and the log-rank test
#
# The Kaplan-Meier estimator uses partially observed follow-up: a patient censored at ten months
# contributes ten months of "still event-free" and nothing after. The log-rank test compares the
# whole curves rather than survival at any one time, which is why it is not a t-test on a
# percentage.

d <- read.csv("fixture.csv")

# PINNED DEFAULT 1: conf.type = "log-log".
#
# EVERY LANGUAGE DISAGREES HERE AND NONE OF THEM SAYS SO IN ITS OUTPUT:
#   R        survfit()          defaults to "log"
#   SAS      PROC LIFETEST      defaults to LOGLOG
#   Python   lifelines          uses exponential Greenwood, which IS the log-log transform
#
# So R's default band and SAS's default band around the same curve are different bands. log-log is
# pinned because it is the one that cannot leave [0, 1]: the plain log transform produces upper
# limits above 1 in the tail, where a survival probability cannot go.

# PINNED DEFAULT 2: rho = 0, which IS the log-rank test.
#
# rho = 1 is the Peto-Peto modification, which weights early differences more heavily; SAS's
# PROC LIFETEST prints the log-rank AND the Wilcoxon AND the likelihood ratio and lets the reader
# choose. They answer different questions and a plan that names "the log-rank test" means this one.
#
# The log-rank has most power against PROPORTIONAL hazards, which is what this fixture generates.
# It is not a general test that two curves differ: where curves CROSS it can return a p near 1
# while the arms are plainly different, and that is a property of the test, not a bug.

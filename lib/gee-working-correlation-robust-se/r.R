# Marginal logistic regression by GEE, on binary outcomes clustered within clinic.
#
# THREE THINGS ARE PINNED HERE AND EVERY ONE OF THEM IS A DEFAULT SOMEWHERE ELSE.
#
# 1. corstr = "exchangeable". geeglm DEFAULTS TO "independence", and so do statsmodels and SAS's
#    PROC GENMOD. Stata's xtgee defaults to EXCHANGEABLE. So the same analysis written in four
#    languages fits two different working correlations depending on which one you started from,
#    and no output says which.
#
# 2. The data are SORTED BY CLUSTER. geeglm requires observations from one cluster to be
#    contiguous; it does not check, and unsorted input is silently treated as many small clusters.
#    That is the failure mode this file guards against by sorting unconditionally, even though the
#    committed fixture already arrives sorted.
#
# 3. BOTH standard errors are reported, under BOTH working correlations. geeglm's summary prints
#    the sandwich; Stata's xtgee prints the MODEL-BASED one unless you ask for vce(robust). How far
#    apart those two are DEPENDS ON THE WORKING CORRELATION, which is why this file reports four
#    numbers and not two: a model-based variance computed under an exchangeable structure already
#    carries the within-clinic correlation and lands near the sandwich, while one computed under
#    independence does not. The dangerous combination is independence with a model-based error --
#    which no single package defaults to, and which is exactly what a file translated from R's
#    default structure to Stata's default variance produces.

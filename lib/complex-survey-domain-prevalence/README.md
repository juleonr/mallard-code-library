# Complex survey prevalence and domain estimation

Weighted binary prevalence and Taylor-linearized standard errors for a one-stage stratified PSU design, retaining all sampled PSUs for a domain estimate. This is a limited worked example, not a general survey-analysis engine.

Declare strata, PSUs and inverse-inclusion-probability weights on the full eligible sample before domain restriction.

PSU identifiers repeat between strata; R uses nest=TRUE, Python groups by both identifiers and Stata creates a combined identifier.

With-replacement Taylor variance, no finite-population correction. The example covers one-stage PSU sampling with small sampling fractions, not replicate-weight, calibrated or multistage designs.

Every sampled PSU, including PSUs with zero domain observations, contributes to the stratum variance calculation.

Missing values, nonpositive weights and unresolved lonely PSUs are rejected. Provider-specific interval and reliability rules remain necessary.

R and Python are executed on the same synthetic fixture. SAS and Stata are unexecuted reference translations. Agreement and recovery are separate checks. Generated adaptations and analyses on user data have not been executed by these checks.

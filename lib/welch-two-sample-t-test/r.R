# Two-sample comparison of means with unequal variances (Welch)
#
# Base R only. t.test is in stats, so this file installs nothing, which is worth noticing: the
# comparison clinicians run most often needs no package at all, and the thing that varies between
# languages is not capability but which test each one runs when you do not say.

d <- read.csv("fixture.csv")

# The arms are selected by the arm COLUMN, not by position. The fixture is shuffled so that an
# implementation reading "the first 1200 rows" fails visibly rather than by luck.
treated <- d$y[d$arm == 1]
control <- d$y[d$arm == 0]

# PINNED DEFAULT: var.equal = FALSE, the Welch test.
#
# This IS R's default and it is named anyway, because it is NOT the default anywhere else:
#   R      t.test()               Welch
#   Python scipy.stats.ttest_ind  POOLED -- equal_var=True is the default
#   Stata  ttest y, by(arm)       POOLED -- unequal must be asked for
#   SAS    proc ttest             prints BOTH and lets the reader choose the wrong one
#
# On this fixture the pooled standard error is 32% smaller than Welch's, because the smaller arm is
# the more variable one. That direction makes the pooled test anti-conservative: it manufactures
# significance rather than losing it.
tt <- t.test(treated, control, var.equal = FALSE)

# The pooled test, computed only so the gap can be reported. It is not the recommended analysis
# here and no interval in this file is built from it.
pooled <- t.test(treated, control, var.equal = TRUE)
